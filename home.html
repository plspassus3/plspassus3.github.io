<center><p>Narrator: One stormy summer night, as you sit and watch TV, the urge to have some snacks comes upon you. The storm has temporarily let up but you decide to drive anyways, only to discover that your car wonâ€™t start. With a slight grimace you pull your hood over your head and start the short walk over to the store. The storm clouds break open again right across the street from it and you huddle inside your jacket. You reach the crosswalk in front of the parking lot.
                     Do you cross the street: </p></center>
