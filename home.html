<center><p>Narrator: One stormy summer night, as you sit and watch TV, the urge to have some snacks comes upon you. The storm has temporarily let up but you decide to drive anyways, only to discover that your car won’t start. With a slight grimace you pull your hood over your head and start the short walk over to the store. The storm clouds break open again right across the street from it and you huddle inside your jacket. You reach the crosswalk in front of the parking lot.
                     Do you cross the street: </p></center>

Sitting up you look around and see a group of men riding horses towards you. Covered in chain mail and tunics they encircle you, their eyes full of curiosity. The leader, who stood out among the others with his gleaming armor and cloak that billowed out behind him, moved closer.“Stranger, you are to come with us.” As another man brought a horse without a rider forward.“Why?” The leader glared down at us.“Come with us. The penalty is death if you do not.” Do you go with them:", "US English Male");' type='button' value='🔊 Play' />
