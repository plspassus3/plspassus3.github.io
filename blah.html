The soldiers turn their horses and surround you as they head back the way they came, forcing you to go with them.</p>
<p>After riding for an hour or so, an old castle towering over a sprawling city comes into view.</p>
<p>The soldiers ride past the gates into the courtyard and dismount.</p> 
<p>One comes over to help you down and they lead you into the castle, directly to the throne room.<p>
<p>Inside an old man sits on the throne, his head in his hands, surrounded by a small group dressed in strange robes.</p>
 <p>Your shoes echo eerily off the walls as the soldiers push you towards the center of the room, towards the throne.</p>
 <p>As you approach the group they turn and peer at you curiously and the old man lifts his head up to look at you.<p>
       <p> “Hello young man,” the old man sounded tired, as though he had done too much for too long, “I am King Orddon of Transcia, welcome to my home.</p>
        <p>“Th-th-thank you sir.” The king smiled a crinkly smile that hid his weariness for a moment.</p>
       <p>“I’m sure you’re wondering why you are here and how you have come to be here, young man.” You nod slowly, wondering if something bad is about to happen. “You are in no danger from us here. You are here because we need your help, because I need your help.”
</p><p>A gesture from the king and a servant brings you a chair to sit on. As you settle onto the seat another servant brings you a cup filled with sweet juice while the king sits, contemplating the scene in front of him. Once you are settled, he begins his story.
</p>    <p>“Many years ago a young witch named Glasa lived at the edge of this kingdom with her little daughter and son. This witch bore no one any ill will and often used her magic to help people who felt they had nowhere else to turn. Illness, heartache, anything that could hurt a person’s body or soul, she would help with. 
 </p>    <p> One day, her little daughter came down with a strange illness. Soon, her son came down with the strange illness as well. The witch tried everything she could think of, everything she knew to heal her children but nothing worked. In a last, desperate attempt to save her children, who were growing weaker with every passing moment, she brought them into the kingdom begging for someone to help her. No one came forward, no one tried to help and both her children died. She took them back to their home and buried them on a hill nearby. She swore to herself that she would never again help the people of this kingdom, for they had turned their backs on her when she needed them the most after she had spent years helping them. She blamed me for her children’s death the most. In her anger, and her grief, she unleashed a plague upon the kingdom that could not be healed by any known medicine. Only she held the cure, only she could lift the plague. The plague spread, covering every corner of the kingdom, until there was no house that was not unaffected by this horror. Not even the royal family was left untouched. My wife, three of my daughters, and my son all succumbed to this plague. The day my youngest and I buried her mother the witch appeared in front of us. Her gray-blue hair whipped against her pale white skin in the wind as she stood there and told me that my daughter now belonged to her and that when I was willing to pay the price, I could have her back.” Your head tilts slightly in confusion. The king sees the confusion on your face and smiles sadly, “the price was to have someone cut my head off and post it on a spike in front of the castle. Much as I love my daughter, I can’t abandon my kingdom like that. This witch is too powerful and too angry for me to trust her to lift the plague after my death. My daughter understands this and I fear she does not expect a rescue any time soon.”
<p>Your mouth falls open in shock as the story unfolds before you and you wonder where this story is going. </p>
       <p>“Your majesty, how do I fit into all this?”</p>
       <p>“My mages have tried everything they can to get rid of this plague and recover my daughter.</p>
	   <p>Their powers and knowledge have been exhausted and the only knowledge they have gained is that the only other way to end the plague is to kill her.</p>
	   <p>My men cannot undertake this mission, the plague has started to creep into their ranks and most of them can no longer sit on their horses for more than a few hours.</p>
	   <p>I need someone young, strong, and so I begged the gods to send us a champion. You, my son, appeared after that prayer which makes you our champion.</p>
<p>	   I am begging you; kill the witch and bring me back my daughter. Save my kingdom from this horrible plague and release us from the witch’s burning anger.</p>
<p>” The king looks straight at you with a look of sadness and hope in his eyes, “will you help me?”</p>
                           <p>Do you undertake this quest:</p>
