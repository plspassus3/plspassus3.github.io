You wake up in a grassy meadow to the sound of hoofs pounding into the ground, coming closer. Sitting up you look around and see a group of men riding horses towards you. Covered in chain mail and tunics they encircle you, their eyes full of curiosity. The leader, who stood out among the others with his gleaming armor and cloak that billowed out behind him, moved closer.‚ÄúStranger, you are to come with us.‚Äù As another man brought a horse without a rider forward.‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù The leader glared down at us.‚ÄúCome with us. The penalty is death if you do not.‚Äù  
                    Do you go with them:</p></center>
