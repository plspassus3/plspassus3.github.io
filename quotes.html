The king stands and walks forward to stand in front of you. A wave of his hand and the mages come forth to surround your chair. One of them draws forth a bag from within his robes and hands it to you.
                      “Within this bag contains many objects that will help you on your journey. Potions, spells, herbs, anything you could want for this quest that pertains to magic and the healing arts. We mages have put in the best that we have to aid you in saving our kingdom.” The mage backed away and the king waved his hand again. This time a giant, with muscle banded arms moves forward and hands you a sword encased in a scabbard to hang from your belt, as well as a shield that was bigger than your torso. You are surprised to find how light the shield is and how easily the sword is to handle. The king takes a folded piece of parchment from a mage and hands it to you.
                       “This is the map that will lead you to her lair. She has buried herself in a mountain cave nearby to watch us suffer more easily,” he points to a spot on the map just outside the castle, “this door will take you out the back entrance of the castle. You will find the Forest of Riddles and somewhere in there is the entrance to her lair. The map will show you the way. Thank you, stranger, I hope you bring me my daughter and Glasa’s head. Kill the witch!

You step through the door that leads to the Forest of Riddles and breath in the cool air. Your shield secured to the bag strapped to your back and your sword at your hip you start through the forest, the map guiding your way, the sun high in the sky.

After walking until the sun has begun to set you come across a merchant standing at the edge of a clearing partway up the mountain. A boulder stands up against the mountainside and as you begin to approach the merchant steps in front of you.
                    “Some healing potions, sir? Food, drinks? Can I interest you in anything?”
                    “No, thank you.”
                    “Are you sure? Dangerous place you’re in.” You stare at him for a moment, wondering who he is and what he wants. Deciding he is safe, you place your hand on the hilt of your sword and give him a slight smile.
                    “I’m sure. I’ll be fine, thank you.” You continue walking towards the boulder, never removing your hand from the hilt of your sword. Behind the boulder you find a narrow entrance concealed behind it. Taking a deep breath you glance back at the merchant, who is shaking his head after you, and step into the cave.</p></center>
